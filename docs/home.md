# Sanic

?> **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**  :construction_worker: These documents are still under construction. Ultimately they will replace the docs at readthedocs, and that page will be strictly API documentation. Any suggestions or support will be welcome [at the repo](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic-guide).
Final version expected to conincide with 21.3 release.  
*Updated January 2021*

Sanic is a Python 3.6+ web server and web framework thatâ€™s written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy.

## What is it?

First things first, before you jump in the water, you should know that Sanic is different than other frameworks.

Right there in that first sentence there is a huge mistake because Sanic is _both_ a **framework** and a **web server**. In the [deployment](/deployment) section we will talk a little bit more about this. 

But, remember, out of the box Sanic comes with everything you need to write, deploy, and scale a production grade web application. :rocket:

## Goal

> To provide a simple way to get up and running a highly performant HTTP server that is easy to build, to expand, and ultimately to scale.
## Features

<!-- panels:start -->

- Built in _fast_ web server
